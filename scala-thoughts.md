## Initial Scalal Thoughts

In some ways I really liked Scala. It felt very clean and intuitive, and the ability to
to pattern match in a more functional way made a lot of sense while I was thinking about
how to solve problems. That being said, since there wasn't always a lot of rigid syntax,
I often had got confused between this and the language R, since I'm also learning that at
the same time. There are a few oddities about R, Scala, and Python that I kept mixing up. 
Variable assignment was a big one that distinguishes all three, but would sometimes catch
myself doing the wrong one. Same with functions and parameters. I really liked Scala's way
of defining functions and how you included the types. But since that isn't common in most
of the other languages that I use on a daily basis, it was easy to forget that I had to.
I could see why a designer might choose to do it that way, and it did help a lot with
debugging type errors.
